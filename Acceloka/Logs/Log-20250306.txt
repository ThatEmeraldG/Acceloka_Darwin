[2025-03-06 04:27:22 WRN] 'AddEntityFramework*' was called on the service provider, but 'UseInternalServiceProvider' wasn't called in the DbContext options configuration. Consider removing the 'AddEntityFramework*' call, as in most cases it's not needed and may cause conflicts with other products and services registered in the same service provider.
